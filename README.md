# AdaGPT3BOT
Ada is a loving, caring and nurturing discord bot created with the OpenAI GPT3 model, it is fine tuned with custom prompts. I created it by making use of the discord API and by utilising the openAI's API.
The bot itself is made using NodeJS. and fine-tuned on davinci model.

As it is a personal project. I will not be giving the prompt's for training or fine-tuning the model. But all the prompts (around 69) were custom and not publically available.
